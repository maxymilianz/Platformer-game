To compile the game, please take a look at the tutorials on:
http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/
in the "getting started" section.

After configuration, put the source files right in Your project directory.

I tested it with Visual Studio. If You face any problems, put the SFML's dll's right in Your project's "Debug" or "Release" directory.
